# Development Rules for Reactor Specification

This document outlines the most important rules and guidelines for developing and maintaining the Reactor language specification.

## Core Development Principles

### Process Discipline
- **Do one point in time!** - Focus on single, well-defined tasks
- **Step by step!** - Break complex work into manageable, sequential steps
- **One point – one task – one commit!** - Each commit addresses exactly one logical change

### Communication and Coordination
- **Don't do anything until I ask!** - Wait for explicit direction before proceeding
- **Get free to use emoji ;)** - Emojis are encouraged for clarity and personality

### Quality Assurance
- **Never touch my fixes!** - Respect and preserve existing corrections
- **Never push to upstream!** - Local commits only, explicit push control required

## Application

These rules apply to all specification development activities:

- Document creation and modification
- Code example updates
- Cross-reference management
- Quality assurance and review
- Version control practices
