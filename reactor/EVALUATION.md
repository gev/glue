# Reactor Evaluation

## Introduction to Evaluation Process Preparation

Before evaluation can begin, the Reactor runtime must be properly prepared. This preparation involves two key steps that establish the foundation for program execution.

## Evaluation Cases

Reactor evaluates the following types of IR nodes:

- **Symbol** - Variable and function name lookup
- **DottedSymbol** - Hierarchical property access
- **List** - Sequence evaluation and function application
- **Object** - Property evaluation and construction
- **Literals** - Self-evaluating values (numbers, strings, etc.)
